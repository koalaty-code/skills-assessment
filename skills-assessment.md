## Git Commands
### What are your favorite git commands? Give a simple description for each.
I have three git commands that are my favorite when used together.
1. `git rm -r --cached .` This removes all files from tracking
2. `git add .` This adds and tracks all files
3. `git commit -m "remove untracked files"` This commits the changes to source control
I use these three commands together when unnecessary files accidentally get added to source control. For example, the `.gitignore` template for Visual Studio does not ignore `.DS_Store` files by default. When working on a Mac, it is easy to commit these files by mistake. After a file has been committed, you can update the `.gitignore`, but the file is already being tracked. To remove the file, you will have to use the above three commands to remove all cached files and then add everything back before committing. Any changes to the `.gitignore` file will take effect once all files are removed from tracking.
